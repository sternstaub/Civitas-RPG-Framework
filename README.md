# CivitasRPG

Open-world city RPG plugin based on PaperMC.

My goal is to create a minecraft-based immersive multiplayer role playing experience through paper plugin. the features i am thinking of are:

* skill system that allows the players to specialize their craft
* player towns with real time strategy elements, chunk protection, ressource gain and upkeep (like in [TownyPlots](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/townyplots) extended, but better)
* dynamic configuration for all of the plugins features, so that server owners may create their own building types for example!

It is developed for the server fallenstar.de. Anyway, i decided to share the code.

I want to thank the [Lyria server and it's staff](https://lyriaserver.de) for all the inspiration regarding the possibilities of minecraft.


***This is at an early stage.***


# working on initial release (0.1).
 

## Planned package structure...

* ...quite some Interfaces...
* ...aswell as enumerations for config values.
* ConfigHandler class that parses the .yml files from plugin folder to ingame object handlers
