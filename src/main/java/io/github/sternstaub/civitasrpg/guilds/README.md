Guilds are basically the frontend of factions. 

Guilds are kind of a "supergroup" for factions, containing at least 1 faction each.

They always have one leader who can manage the factions which are members of the guild 
(adding them to a town occupied by the guild, for example). Also, factions may only be created and 
only exist within a guild.

The guild leader will not have total control over the factions tho. A faction might 
decide that they want to split apart from their parent guild, declaring themselves as the main
faction of a new guild while leaving the old one in the process.

They will come with functions like... 
* PvP-prevention
* economy balance
* internal permissions 
* internal chat
* direct trading between factions which belong to the guild
* bounty quests (...later)
* two guilds can declare war to each other and take over enemy towns after
* a taxation and trading fee system
* buying benefits for guild's factions with coin

Please consider this only a preview. Things may change.~~~~
