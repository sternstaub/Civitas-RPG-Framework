Guilds are basically the frontend of factions. 

While factions are used rather in the background 
(for organizing stuff like permissions), guilds are kind of a "supergroup" for factions;
a guild is like a container for the factions.

Each guild needs to contain at least 1 faction. 


Guilds, on the other hand, will have 
a more direct impact on the player's ingame experience. They always have one leader
who can manage the factions in the guild (adding them to a town occupied by the guild,
for example)

They will come with functions like... 
* PvP-prevention
* economy balance
* internal permissions 
* internal chat
* direct trading between factions which belong to the guild
* bounty quests (...later)
* two guilds can declare war to each other and take over enemy towns after
* a taxation and trading fee system
* buying benefits for guild's factions with coin

Please consider this only a preview. Things may change.~~~~
